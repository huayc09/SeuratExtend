\title{Create the 'seuratextend' Conda Environment}
\usage{
create_condaenv_seuratextend(force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{force}{Logical; if TRUE, removes any existing 'seuratextend' environment before creating a new one. Default is FALSE. Use this parameter to force recreation of the environment if a previous installation was interrupted or incomplete.}
}
\value{
Does not return any value; it creates and configures a new Conda environment.
}
\description{
Initializes a Conda environment named 'seuratextend' which includes all necessary Python packages for running `scVelo`, `Palantir`, and `CellRank` via `SeuratExtend`. This function is ideal for users setting up their analytical environment for the first time or those who need to ensure they have a compatible environment setup.
}
\details{
When you run functions from `SeuratExtend` that require Python integrations, such as `scVelo`, `Palantir`, or `CellRank`, you might need a specific set of Python packages installed. This function facilitates the setup of a Conda environment specifically tailored for these tools, managed through `reticulate`.

The environment setup is automatic and checks your operating system to configure appropriately. It is currently supported and tested on:
* Windows (Intel/AMD processors)
* macOS (both Intel-based and Apple Silicon/M-series processors)
* Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)

The function automatically detects Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) Macs and uses the appropriate configuration.

If force=TRUE is used, any existing 'seuratextend' environment will be removed before creating a new one. This can be useful when:
* A previous installation was interrupted
* Required dependencies were not properly installed
* You need to reset the environment to a clean state
* You encounter persistent environment-related errors

\dontrun{
# Standard installation
create_condaenv_seuratextend()

# Force recreation of the environment
create_condaenv_seuratextend(force = TRUE)
